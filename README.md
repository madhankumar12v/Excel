# EXCEL VBA CODE #

**In excel, you have to enable first the macro (and select the developper option). **
** Then you can press ALT + F11 to go into edit macro mode. To learn you can start with "recording macro" to see what excel is recording, **
** but it's not the most efficient way **

#### How to Use:

#### Open an Excel Workbook
#### Press Alt+F11 to open VBA Editor
#### Go to Insert Menu >> Module
#### In the module, paste the below program
#### Save the file as Macro Enabled Workbook (xlsm) or Excel 97-2003 Workbook (xls)
